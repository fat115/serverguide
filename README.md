This edit does that :
- Add internationalization support (intllib : https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=4929) and french translation 
- Colorize book
- Change book from tool to item and add group book so it can be placed in bookshelves
- Replace label by textarea in formspec for automatic break lines
- Add use of files for tab content 
- Add option to add to inventory to add to inventory of new player
- Tab content files stored in world folder, so rules can be world specific

 = Look for file and create it if need when server start ( works a lot like this : https://github.com/xisd/random_messages wich is a fork of this : https://github.com/arsdragonfly/random_messages )
